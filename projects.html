      <p>Work completed for Clayton Tutty Construction</p>
      <p>
        Clayton Tutty’s clients wanted to extend their home and opted for
        a second-storey addition, which required new plumbing to be
        connected to their existing plumbing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team at Clayton Tutty Construction are fantastic to work with.
        We came into the project with a good understanding of what the
        builders and client wanted and took direction from both throughout the
        build.
      </p>
      <p>
        The architect presented us with clear plans about what was required.
        Working through the plans to connect into the existing plumbing was
        straightforward.
      </p>
      <p>PLUMBING WORK REQUIRED:</p>
      <ul class="list-unstyled">
        <li>New bathroom</li>
        <li>
          Connecting new plumbing on the house’s second storey
          to existing plumbing on the first storey
        </li>
        <li>Installation of an instantaneous water heater</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="highlight">NEW HOME BUILD IN STILLWATER</h2>
      <p>Work completed for the House of Nautica</p>
      <p>
        New home builds can be fantastic to work on – they’re a blank canvas
        without the challenges of renovations, where you’re working within an
        existing framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        The owners of the Stillwater property required plumbing work to be
        completed on two dwellings within their section – a larger house and a
        minor dwelling with a smaller bathroom and laundry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inevitably with a new build, plans were altered during the project, which
        required us to adaptable and flexible. In order to keep the project
        running smoothly, we ensured we always turned up on site on time.
