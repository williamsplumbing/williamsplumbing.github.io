      <p>Work completed for Clayton Tutty Construction</p>
      <p>
        Clayton Tutty’s clients wanted to extend their home and opted for
        a second-storey addition, which required new plumbing to be
        connected to their existing plumbing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team at Clayton Tutty Construction are fantastic to work with.
        We came into the project with a good understanding of what the
        builders and client wanted and took direction from both throughout the
        build.
      </p>
      <p>
        The architect presented us with clear plans about what was required.
        Working through the plans to connect into the existing plumbing was
        straightforward.
